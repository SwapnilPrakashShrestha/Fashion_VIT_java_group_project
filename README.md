README for Fashion E-Retail Platform Overview
This project is a simple version of a Fashion E-Retail Platform that is built in Java. This project is demonstrating layering architecture, object oriented programming and various design patterns including strategy, factory and singleton.
Project Structure
Product.java
Clothing.java
Accessory.java
Order.java
OrderItem.java
DiscountStrategy.java
SeasonalDiscount.java
LoyaltyDiscount.java
PaymentMethod.java
PayPalPayment.java
CardPayment.java
PaymentFactory.java
InventoryManager.java
MainTest.java

How to Run
Compile Java files:
    javac *.java

Run the program:
    java MainTest
Program Output
Order Total: 60.0
After Seasonal Discount: 54.0
Paid 54.0 using Card (1111-2222-3333-4444)

Encapsulation – The fields are private and only accessed through methods.
Inheritance – Product inherits from Clothing and Accessory.
Polymorphism – Discounts are handled differently based on the type of discount used (e.g., Seasonal or Loyalty).
Abstraction – Abstract classes are used to represent the behavior of PaymentMethod; Card and PayPal implement the abstract classes.
Composition – Orders contain one or more OrderItems.
Aggregation – Although it's not fully implemented in code, a conceptual example of an aggregate would be a Cart holding multiple Products.
Design Patterns
Strategy Pattern – Flexible discount strategies can be created and swapped out without modifying existing code.
Factory Pattern – Payment methods can be dynamically created and used without having to manually create them each time.
Singleton Pattern – Centralized inventory management.

Step-by-Step Description of How the Flow Works
1. Create a new Clothing product.
2. Create an order, add items to the order.
3. Calculate total cost of the items in the order.
4. Apply a seasonal discount of 10%.
5. Use the PaymentFactory to select card payment as the way to pay.
6. Process the payment.
